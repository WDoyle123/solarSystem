# SolarSystem

[solarSystem Live Demo](https://wdoyle123.github.io/solarSystem/)

## Overview
solarSystem is a JavaScript simulation using the p5.js library to model a basic solar system. It includes a sun, planets, and moons with newtonian gravitational interactions. The simulation runs in a web browser and provides a visual representation of the orbital mechanics based on Newtonian physics.

## Features
- Simulation of a solar system with a central sun.
- Dynamic creation of planets and moons.
- Gravitational interactions between celestial bodies.
- Real-time orbit and path tracking for each body.
- Customisable parameters for planet and moon generation.
